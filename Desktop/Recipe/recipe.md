This burger recipe is made in 2 parts. The
first one is making the burger patties and
the other one is assembling. Making these
veg burgers is really easy if you plan ahead.

I start by steaming the veggies for the burger
patties in a steamer or cooker. While they
steam I prepare the lettuce, onions and
tomatoes for the topping. I usually make
the dressing a day ahead and refrigerate
 so that saves some time.
 
I use a large pan and shallow fry all the
4 to 6 burger patties at one go. This really
saves a lot of time rather than frying them 
in batches.
  
This time I pan fried some and shallow fried some
to show you, so did them in batches. The easiest
of all these is to grill these in an oven or air
fryer in a single batch
